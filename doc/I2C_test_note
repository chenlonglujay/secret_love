1. arduino Meag 2560 burning program "test_I2C.ino" and using Serial Monitor to observe
    receive data from raspberry Pi3 by I2C  

2. raspberry Pi3 
    (1) cd c++
    (2) make I2C
    (3) ./I2C_control
    (4) type data (format: xxxxxx)
        ex: 010101
    (5) cd ../python
    (6) python I2C_send_command_from_shm.py
    (7) if you need to send next data ,that data must difference before
        otherwise python doesn't send data this time
3. then you will see like below
    ---python view---
    command: 1
    valueH:  1
    valueL:  1
    
    ---arduino view---
    command:1
    valueH:1
    valueL:1

if you go through above operation ,this I2C function is correct
*maybe arduino and pi has difference voltage level,so pi couldn't receives data from arduino*   

notice:
if you send command is 030000(jog mode), motor will start rotating and doesn't stop
 until you send 040000 stop command
