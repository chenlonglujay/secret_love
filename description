(1)reapberry pi:
This project use camera to detect hunman(openCV) face and control step motor to rotate head 
,pi use I2C to communicate with arduino Mega 2560,control behavier list below 

						pi					=>		arduino 
command		motor rotate				make pluses to drive motor	
					motor stop					stop to make pulses
					face LED on					turn LED on
					face LED off				turn LED off
