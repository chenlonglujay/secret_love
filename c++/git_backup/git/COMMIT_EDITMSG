you can test to send I2c command data to share memory as follows
(1) make sendI2C
(2) ./I2C_test <argv> (I2C_test.cpp uses send_I2C_command class)
    argv:0,messages like below, key in command and press enter
    please key in number (data format: nnnnnn),press enter will exit
    
    argv:1,motor will start rotate(jog mode) until key in 040000(stop),
	  you can use "ctrl+c" to exit,then execute ./I2C_test 0 to key
	  in 040000
    notice: remember to execute "python pythonI2C_send_command_from_shm.py"
	    ,that can sends command to arduino by I2C
